            eXchangily, a multi-functional 3-in-1 cryptocurrency platform, provides access to a decentralized wallet, a crypto exchange, and flash payments.  
        </mat-card-content>
        <mat-card-content>
            eXchangily’s mission is to provide its users with a full range of integrated crypto-digital currency applications and management tools to a wide variety needs including digital asset storage, management, crypto trading, investment, financial services, and other real-life applications. 
        </mat-card-content>
        <mat-card-content>
            The platform’s key feature is decentralization. Assets will always be under the control of its users without interference from other institutions or individuals. As a result, you will not lose control of your assets, whether stored in the wallet or an exchange transaction provided that you do not share the private key.
        </mat-card-content>
        <mat-card-content>
            In any eXchangily wallet, the private key, a mnemonic phrase formed by a set of twelve words, is the only access point to your wallet. As long as your keys remain private, your assets will always be safe and secure.

            <p><b>1.2 Functions</b></p>
            <p>eXchangily consists of six functional modules as follows: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>eXchangily wallet</li>
                <li>crypto exchange</li>
                <li>flash payment - BindPay </li>
                <li>OTC</li>
                <li>blockchain browser</li>
                <li>auxiliary functions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Users can navigate these sections in the menu.</p>
            <p>The menu is divided into two areas, left and right. The left side comprises the decentralized core functions and the right side houses the centralized auxiliary functions.
            </p>
            <p><img src="/images/help/en/image1.png" class="photo"></p>
            <p>
                The sections in the key functional areas are <b>Wallet</b>, <b>Market</b>, <b>Trade</b>, <b>Explore</b>, <b>OTC Trade</b>, <b>Mint Token</b>, and <b>BindPay</b>. The wallet functions as an independent decentralized wallet, while market, trade, and flash payments (BindPay) all are decentralized exchange functions. The blockchain browser shows the records of all transactions on the blockchain, and fiat currency trading is a semi-decentralized function that provides transactions between fiat currency and cryptocurrency.
            </p>
            <p>Auxiliary functions include an introduction about the project, news updates, service support, community communications, events, and settings. These help users navigate eXchangily and communicate important updates and events. </p>

            <b>2. Exchangily Wallet</b>
        </mat-card-content>
        <mat-card-content>
            Wallets are the gateway to cryptocurrency; the first step to get involved is creating and owning a wallet.
            <br><br>
            <p><b>2.1 Create a wallet</b></p>
            <p>To create a wallet on the eXchangily platform, select <b>Wallet</b> in the menu navigation bar. If you are visiting the website for the first time on your device, a randomly generated set of words called a mnemonic phrase will pop up automatically. Copy these words precisely and make sure to keep them in a safe location. The best practice is to physically write it out and store it safely. In the case where a key is kept electronically and something happens to the device, you may lose the mnemonic and thus, access to the wallet. (The image below shows an example of a mnemonic phrase.)
            </p>
            <p>Once copied, press <b>Next</b> to enter and verify the key. </p>
            <p><img src="/images/help/en/image3.png" class="photo"></p>
            <p>After entering the mnemonic, <b>Confirm</b>. If you click <b>Back</b> on this page, a new set of words will generate and you will have to recopy them. </p>
            <p><img src="/images/help/en/image5.png" class="photo"></p>
            <p>Next, name the wallet and set a password. The wallet names are for reference purposes only, and in the case that you have multiple wallets, you can use the names to distinguish between the private keys. (There are many reasons for multiple wallets such as a cold wallet, where you only deposit money and do not withdraw, or a hot wallet, which serves as a checking account and sees many transactions.)</p>
            <p>When creating the main wallet password, choose a strong password that fits the following requirements: eight or more characters, including at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special symbol (! @#$%^&*). The password functions only as  encryption on your device for the mnemonics to prevent hackers from accessing the wallet. Since the password is specific to the device it was created on and not stored externally on a remote server, you cannot recover or access the wallet via the wallet name and password on other devices.</p>
            <p>The wallet name and password do not need to be memorized since you can recover a wallet with your mnemonic private key and reset the wallet name and password.</p>

            <p>Click on <b>Submit</b> to complete!</p>

            <p><b>2.2 Restoring a Wallet</b></p>
        </mat-card-content>
        <mat-card-content>
            <p>You can restore your wallet if it was deleted or is on another device. There are two methods, dependent on if your device has an existing wallet:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If your device does not have a wallet recorded, the <b>Create New Wallet</b> page will pop up automatically. Select <b>Existing Mnemonics? Restore</b>, then hit <b>Restore</b> to reach the wallet recovery page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If another wallet exists on the device, select <b>Import Wallet</b> in the <b>My Wallet</b> function bar on the right side of the main wallet page.
                </li>
            </ul>
           <p><img src="/images/help/en/image7.png" class="photo"></p>
            <p>Rename the wallet and reset the password – they can be the same or different from the previous name and password. Type the mnemonics with each word separated by a space. Once the set of words is in, select Restore Wallet to complete the process.  </p>

            <p>2.3.1 Page Structure</p>
            <p>The wallet page consists of five areas: menu, summary, asset list, management, and help center.</p>
            <p><img src="/images/help/en/image8.png" class="photo"></p>

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Summary</b>

                <br> Displays an overview of the wallet and controls coin transactions
                <br> The wallet name, created when opening or restoring a wallet, is displayed under <b>My Wallet</b>.
                <br> To the top right, the balance of EXG is shown with its value corresponding to fiat currency. EXG is the platform coin of eXchangily and users can profit from dividends of eXchangily trading income.
                <br> The <b>Wallet Address</b> shows the EXG or FAB address. Aside from receiving EXG or FAB coins, it is also a unique identifier used in exchange, flash payment, and other functions. You can copy the address by selecting the symbol to the right. 
                <br> The <b>Exchange Gas Balance</b> shows the wallet’s gas balance. To use the exchange to deposit coins or trade, you will need gas since each action uses it. The first step is to have FAB in your wallet.
                <br> <b>Receive</b> allows you to receive money from other wallets.
                <br> <b>Send</b> makes payments and transfers to other wallets.
                <br> <b>Add Gas</b> adds gas to the exchange.
                <br> <b>Exchange</b> navigates the platform and is equivalent to <b>Trade</b> in the menu.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Asset List Area</b>
                <br> Lists all the coins supported by the wallet and the balance of each currency in that wallet
                <br> Each row shows the icon, symbol, available balance in your wallet, locked balance, value in USD, dividend, and the action performed, if any. 
                <br> Selecting the icon will display basic information of the coin, and selecting the down arrow to the far right opens the page to transfer coins into the exchange. The down arrow will not display if the gas balance is 0 since fuel will need to be added first.
                <br> Select <b>Transaction History</b> at the top right of the asset section to view the transaction history of the wallet. Please note that the receiving history will not show here. Transfers to the wallet can be confirmed through the balance, or be verified via the detailed transaction record on the coin’s blockchain browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Management Area</b>

            <p>2.3.2 Common wallet operation Guidelines</p>
            <p>Common wallet functions include money transactions, adding gas, coin deposits, transaction history, adding a display password to the wallet, wallet deletion, smart contract operations, etc.</p>
            <p>2.3.2.1 Receiving money</p>
            <p>Select <b>Receive</b> in the summary area to open the Receive window. Once you choose the currency that you will receive, the corresponding wallet address and QR code will show. To send the wallet address to the other party, you can copy and send it to them or they can also scan the QR code directly. The payment address is not confidential, similar to a bank account number, so you can send it via text message, email, WeChat, or any social platform.</p>
            <p><img src="/images/help/en/image6.png" class="photo"></p>
            <hr>
            <p>2.3.2.2 Payment</p>
            <p>Select <b>Send</b> in the summary area and the payment window will pop up. To send currency, make sure that the recipient’s wallet address is accurate. Then, choose the currency, specify the coin quantity, write a quick note on the transaction, and select <b>Send</b>.
            </p>
            <p><img src="/images/help/en/image10.png" class="photo"></p>
            <p>Few things about payments:
                <br>After selecting the currency, make sure that there are sufficient chain coins in the wallet to pay the transaction fee. (e.g. If you want to transfer USDT (ERC-20) coins, allocate enough ETH to pay the Ether blockchain transaction fee. If you want to transfer USDT (TRC-20), ensure there is enough TRX to pay the wave field transaction fee. Similarly, transferring EXG, DUSD, BST, and DSC will require enough FAB to pay the transaction fee.)
                <br>Usually, the default transaction fee of the system is sufficient to process the payment. However, sometimes blockchain transactions are frequent and volatile, and the default transaction fee may be too low. In those cases, transactions may not be completed instantly (common on Ethereum or Bitcoin blockchain). To prevent this, you can set a higher transaction fee rate by toggling <b>Advanced</b>.
            </p>
            <p><img src="/images/help/en/image2.png" class="photo"></p>
            <p>Enter the wallet password and select <b>Confirm</b> to complete the transfer.
                Note: After the transfer is complete, the processing time is dependent on the corresponding blockchain. Some blockchains are fast and the transaction will complete in seconds, but others are slower and can take a few minutes, hours, or even days. You can click on the transaction number in <b>Transaction History</b> for status updates.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>2.3.2.3 Add Gas to the Exchange</p>
            <p>To use the exchange, you will need FAB first since all actions will require gas (e.g. depositing coins). Since eXchangily uses FAB coins as its gas, you will need to add FAB coins to your wallet.</p>
            <p><b>How do I get FAB coins?</b> There is a multitude of ways to add gas. eXchangily sometimes offers free FAB, but you can also buy gas from others, buy via fiat coins through the OTC channel, or mine them yourself. To use the exchange, you will need FAB coins.</p>
            <p>If you already have FAB in your wallet, select <b>Add Gas</b> to bring up the Add Gas window. Fill in the amount of Gas you want to add. A few FAB coins are usually sufficient to handle multiple transactions. Select <b>Confirm</b>, and verify with your password. You may have to wait a few minutes for the gas balance number to update before you can deposit coins to the exchange.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>2.3.2.4 Deposit coins to eXchangily</p>
            <p>The trading area is separate from the wallet, although still controlled by the same mnemonic. To trade a particular coin, you must first move that coin from your wallet to the exchange. 
                Note: eXchangily is a decentralized exchange and coins transferred to the exchange will still be controlled by your wallet's private key. No one can touch your assets, whether they are pending or canceled since they are controlled by your private key.</p>
            <p>In the asset list area, the down arrow at the end of each coin line will confirm if it can deposit into the exchange. If no down arrow shows, there is not sufficient gas to complete the transaction and you will need to add gas.</p>
            <p>Transferring coins to an exchange is a cross-chain operation. In addition to eXchangily having enough FAB, the wallet must also have sufficient coins of the transferring blockchain to pay that blockchain’s fees. (e.g. If you want to transfer USDT (ERC-20) coins, allocate enough ETH to pay the Ether blockchain transaction fee. If you want to transfer USDT (TRC-20), ensure there is enough TRX to pay the wave field transaction fee. Similarly, transferring EXG, DUSD, BST, and DSC will require enough FAB to pay the transaction fee.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The down arrow will open the deposit window. Enter the quantity to be deposited, select <b>Confirm</b>, and verify by reentering your password. 
            </p>
            <p>
                NOTE: Because depositing coins to the exchange is a cross-chain operation, you will need to wait for both blockchains to process before coins will show in exchange and be available to trade.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>2.3.2.5 Display settings</p>
            <p>The system can also set a display password aside from the main password set at wallet creation. The display password hides and shows the wallet information and display settings. The main password encrypts the mnemonics and is required to change both the main and display passwords. If no display password exists, it will default to the main password.</p>
