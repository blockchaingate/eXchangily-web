However, since investor B had sold EXG before the campaign ends and became disqualified, investor A will not earn rewards on investor B. Investor A will continue to earn rewards on all referrals made by investor B at tier 3 rates. In the case of investor A, if 100,000 EXG tokens are purchased in tier 2 (not including tokens from investor B), 200,000 EXG in tier 3 and 500,000 in tier 4. Investor A would earn ((100,000 x 10%) + (200,000 x 6%) + (500,000 x 3%)) 37,000 EXG tokens as a reward. To qualify for a reward your direct referrals (all of tier 2 in the case or investor A) must provide your referral code and fulfill the monetary requirements for their chosen tier. All purchasers are considered tier 1 once they have fulfilled the monetary and referral requirements for their given Tier",

Example, Ken recruited 10 people and made a $3000USD EXG purchase and now qualifies for the team reward. One arm of Kens’ tree was run by Mary and generated $300K while the other 9 arms only generated $80K, thus Ken has $380K of investment under his umbrella. However the funds generated by Mary exceed 50% of Kens’ umbrella, therefore Marys’ umbrella contribution is $150K, plus 80K from the other arms, for a total of $270K.
